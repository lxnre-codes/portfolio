    summary:
      "Hey there! Welcome to my digital corner of the internet. Fair warning: what you're about to see is basically my resume in its Sunday best (just with better fonts and cooler animations), sometimes my thoughts & writings as well. I'm that calm, easy-going and very playful engineer who's been cooking up some pretty neat stuff on backend, blockchain and e-commerce projects . Think of me as your friendly neighborhood problem-solver, but instead of Spider-Man's web-shooters, I use golang to save the day. Shall i tell you? My main tools are critical thinking and witty jokes ‚Äì though I'm told I should probably just do more of the thinking & coding part üòî üôÅ (not that my jokes are not funny, but hey!! haters gon hate, potatoes gon potate üòåü§™!!!). Agghh this is hard, but yeah that's all i can squeeze out of my brain üß†üòé...",
